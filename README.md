# IntersectionalityInFilm
PIC16B Group Project - machine learning model that provides recommendations for films representing intersectional identities.

Abstract

Diverse representation empowers viewers who share the same identity as the movie characters and the cast, as it reflects experiences that the viewers can sympathize with.

Accurate representation in media production includes not only having diverse set of cast shown on the big screen but also an equally heterogenous composure of the crew, cast production, and writers whose voices are echoed in the works we see.While the film and TV show industry have slowly included more variety in representations of identities in the starring roles, diverse representation is still sorely lacking and much of the representation that exists presently in the repertoire is far from being accurate.

Our model would allow users to input identities of interest and receive a list of best-rated film and TV shows reflecting those identities either through the story itself or the cast and the crew involved in its creation.
